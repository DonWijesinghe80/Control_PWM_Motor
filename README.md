# Control PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) Motor

This project demonstrates how to start, stop, and regulate the speed of a DC motor with a PWM controller from a PWM enabled Android device (typically a commercial Android device).

Here I used .NET System.IO FileStream class to write to the PWM drivers.

### Technologies
•	C#

•	Xamarin Forms

### Requirements
•	An Android device with PWM pin

•	Verify that PWM Directories have been pre-installed (i.e., “/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0/”).
